<h>Predicting Method of Transportation</h>
<p>In this project , we  have approached the method of travel classication" task using dierent classiers and preprocessing
steps. The dataset is an augmented version of Concordia University's private TRIP Dataset combined with gaseous pollutants data of Montreal OpenData and weather
network data. The performances of logistic regression, feed forward neural network, Support Vector Machine (SVM),and random forest have been compared. Random forest
shows the best accuracy 72.7%, followed by neural network (54%), logistic regression (53.5%), and SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel (52.7%), respectively. </p>
